# ⚽ Non-Match Events: Expanding the Meta-Game

Non-match events are the narrative and strategic core of the game. They not only add flavor to each season and personalize the player experience, but they also directly impact how matches are played. Each event can modify stats, relationships, unlock content, or activate special missions that shift the gameplay focus.

## 🧩 Purpose

- Generate **unique runs**: no two seasons feel the same.
- Encourage **emergent playstyles**: builds focused on Social, Money, Technique, etc.
- Build a **branching narrative** where choices shape the character and their world.
- Increase **narrative roleplay**: players can "act out" different footballer personalities.

## 🧠 Types of Non-Match Events

### 1. **Mission-Type Events**

These activate missions or special conditions for the next match.

- **Example:**
  _"You claimed in an interview you’re going to score 3 goals for sure"_
  → The next match has an active mission. Fulfill it for big rewards—or face narrative and stat consequences.

- **Example:**
  _"You accept a bribe not to shoot on goal"_
  → Your mission is to finish the match with 0 shots. Risk and narrative tension.

### 2. **Stat-Based Events**

Directly modify the player's attributes, either temporarily or permanently.

- Physical, Mental, Technical
- Relationships (Coach, teammates, fans)
- Money, Fame, Party Animal, Confidence

### 3. **Non-Direct Events**

Do not affect matches or stats directly but unlock content, opportunities, or narrative branches.

- Cosmetics, Badges
- Unique events
- Club or brand decisions
- Narrative relationships (icons, romance, fans)

## 🌐 Choice and Consequence

Not every decision is about good vs. bad. Often, it's about **what kind of player you want to be**, and embracing the consequences:

- **Party Animal** → +Fans, +Fame, -Mental, chaotic events.
- **High Discipline** → +Coach Relationship, -Popularity.
- **Stat-focused** → Better performance, less juicy narrative.
- **Active Social Life / Romance** → Unique events, possible inner conflicts.

## 🔁 Causality and Reward System

Each event can:

- Modify stats for upcoming matches.
- Change key relationships (Coach, teammates, fans).

## 🧬 Example of Stat Synergy

One event → modifies stats → changes gameplay → changes world perception.

> Example:
>
> - You party the night before the derby.
> - Coach benches you early due to poor performance.
> - Next event is an interview where you must explain yourself.
> - Play it well → regain fans. Fail → lose reputation, benched again.
