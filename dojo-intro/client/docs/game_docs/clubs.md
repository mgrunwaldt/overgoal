# Clubs

Every club is defined by team-wide stats:

- **Offense** – Controls how strong attacks are.
- **Defense** – Measures overall backline strength.
- **Intensity** – Affects aggression and pressing (can cause fouls/injuries).
- **Set Pieces** – Dead ball expertise.
- **Chemistry** – How well team plays together; boosts or limits other stats.
