# Match Decision Calculations

## Shooting Formula:

(Shooting + Intelligence)/2 _ EnergyLeft _ FieldPosition = ShotSuccess%

Other actions (cross, pass, dribble) follow similar multipliers using:

- Relevant Skill
- Intelligence
- Energy
- Match context

Energy decreases after every action and over time. Match context can include score, weather, crowd, pressure.

Team rating impacts how often youâ€™re involved in match actions.
